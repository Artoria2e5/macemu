# make for browser without pthreads

# build for native once first, we need the generated cpu emulator code

# (once, otherwise configure will say c compiler is broken)
source ~/code/tools/emsdk_portable/emsdk_env.sh

# building for SharedArrayBuffer worker mode
./_embuild.sh 
# or for main thread mode
macemujs_conf_mainthread=1 ./_embuild.sh 

# then to compile and convert to js
make && ./_emafterbuild.sh 
```

to clean without deleting generated cpu emulator code (which can only be build in native mode):

```
make mostlyclean
```
