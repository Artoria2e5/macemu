### How this works

Basically, the emulator code is compiled with Emscripten and run in a Web Worker. Communication with the main thread happens by reading and writing SharedArrayBuffers shared between the main browser thread and the worker, which allows the emulator code to run without ever yielding (which makes porting much simpler).

Emscripten provides an implementation of SDL, but it doesn't work when the code is running in a web worker, so I've hacked the SDL video implementation to write to the SharedArrayBuffer instead of calling SDL APIs, which you can see [here](https://github.com/jsdf/macemu/blob/80557e8ff1f411f0fe850669502c2ba5fe056b96/BasiliskII/src/SDL/video_sdl.cpp#L2446-L2449) which calls [this JS function](https://github.com/jsdf/macemu/blob/1730d17db9e8f3832397e91ce2a43a43aaccfeae/BasiliskII/src/Unix/BasiliskII-worker-boot.js#L136-L146) to write to shared memory, which is read from the main thread [here](https://github.com/jsdf/macemu/blob/1730d17db9e8f3832397e91ce2a43a43aaccfeae/BasiliskII/src/Unix/BasiliskII-worker-ui-thread.js#L148-L171). I experimented with locking the video surface when reading and writing, but it hurt performance due to lock contention, and because we use a video frame buffer at a fixed location, even if the UI thread reads a frame which is being in the middle of being written, it's not really noticable.

Mouse and keyboard input are just sent as values in another SharedArrayBuffer communicated [here (UI thread JS)](https://github.com/jsdf/macemu/blob/1730d17db9e8f3832397e91ce2a43a43aaccfeae/BasiliskII/src/Unix/BasiliskII-worker-ui-thread.js#L66-L117], read in the worker thread JS [here]
(https://github.com/jsdf/macemu/blob/1730d17db9e8f3832397e91ce2a43a43aaccfeae/BasiliskII/src/Unix/BasiliskII-worker-boot.js#L91-L119), when requested from the C code [here](https://github.com/jsdf/macemu/blob/80557e8ff1f411f0fe850669502c2ba5fe056b96/BasiliskII/src/SDL/video_sdl.cpp#L2167-L2230), and . I had to add a map of JS keycodes to ADB (Apple) keycodes.

The implementation of audio uses a queue of buffers in shared memory, which each have a flag signifying whether they are full and ready to be consumed by the UI thread, or empty and ready to be written by the emulator thread. The emulator thread will ensure that there are several buffers of audio queued up, to avoid gaps in playback in the case of a slowdown. When the emulator is built natively, audio has a dedicated thread to avoid slowness on the emulator thread affecting playback, but to make things simpler I've just hacked in a call to output audio directly into the emulator's main loop [here](https://github.com/jsdf/macemu/blob/80557e8ff1f411f0fe850669502c2ba5fe056b96/BasiliskII/src/Unix/main_unix.cpp#L1261-L1265). This could be improved by using Emscripten's pthreads support to spawn a separate audio thread.

In future this implementation could be improved by moving all of the shared memory communication to C code by leveraging Emscripten's pthreads support. In this scenario the emulator code would start up, spawn a thread to run the emulator main loop, and then yield back to the browser. Instead of creating SharedArrayBuffers to communicate video, audio, and input, Emscripten's pthreads mode makes the entire C heap memory space a SharedArrayBuffer, with each spawned thread running in a web worker. The JS would simply read and write values on the C heap. This would also unblock using threads in the emulator code (currently not easy due to Chrome's lack of support for web workers spawning other web workers).
